### Exercises

1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search. What's the maximum
number of steps it would take?

R/: 7

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?

R/: 8

1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person's phone number in the phone book

R/: O(Log n) // Binary Search

1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person's name in the phone book. (Hint: You'll have to search 
through the whole book!)

R/: O(n) // Simple search

1.5 You want to read the number of every person in the phone book.

R/: O(n)

1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As

R/: O(n)
